# GMAEmu (Working title)

This is an attempt at creating a basic GBA emulator.  The goal is to be 
semi-accurate with timing, since that was an issue with GBEmu.

Currently, no components are fully implemented. 
Right now, I am working on the following:

* ARM instruction decoding
* Decompilation
* Instruction execution (soon™️)

The most immediate goal is to run ARMWrestler.
